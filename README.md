## 🦾 About the Project

This STL file represents an early design for a robotic hand created to help transfer and move objects smoothly and efficiently.  
The focus of the design is on simple, articulated finger structures that can simulate basic grasping motion.



## 🛠️ Usage

You can import the `.stl` file into:

- **Tinkercad** – for visualization or editing  
- **Fusion 360 / Blender** – for advanced modeling  

## 📁 Files Included

- Neat Elzing-Wluff.stl` – 3D model of the robotic hand prototype
- 3 screenshot



Designed with simplicity in mind — to experiment with functional finger designs in robotic applications.
